Osso provides an open-source microservice for authenticating users against SAML-based Identity Providers.

You deploy your own instance of Osso and use it to onboard enterprise accounts using the Admin UI,
Rest API, or by integrating Bobber, our React component that allows an enterprise user to configure 
their own Identiy Provider.

Consume your Osso microservice's OAuth server in your own application to begin signing SAML based users into your application.
